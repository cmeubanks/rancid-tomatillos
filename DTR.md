# DTR: Define the Relationship

Project: 

Group Member Names:  Peter Muellerleile, Caroline Eubanks

Goals and Expectations for the Project (What does each group member hope to get out of this project? What do we want to achieve as a team? How will we know that we're successful?):

- Scores of 3 on all rubric categories. 
- Develop and demonstrate a solid fundamental understanding of React and React testing.
- Maintain open communication, and if any conflicts arise we bring them to the table direcly and compassionately.
	
Team strengths & collaboration styles (consider discussing your Pairin qualities here):

- We both bring a flexible, adaptive, and hard-working collaboration and work style to the table and hope to continue all of that.

Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually? What constraints do we have? Make sure to discuss the remote questions above in regards to this section):

- Ideally we'll take advantage of any afternoon work time, take a little break after class to "go outside", then continue working through the evening until a hard cutoff time of 8pm.

Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open? How will we make decisions as a team? How will we communicate about our emotional and mental well-being with each other?):

- We'll be talking every morning/afternoon on Slack keep in touch and plan our SH chats / paired programming.
- Daily paired programming on Zoom and check-ins re: next meets.

Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):

- Both of us work hard and plan to pull our weight 50/50.

Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests/Debugging and Problem-solving Techniques): 

- Keep an eye on number of commits and PRs on GitHub and try to keep everything roughly even.
- Work together frequently over TeleType or Tuple to avoid merge conflicts.

Pomodoro Break Schedule:

- We tend to forget them and need to keep that in mind!
- Weekend: "walk around the block" break in mornings, then short breaks every 45-60 min for the rest of the day.  Longer dinner break around 6.

What do we do when we get stuck?

- Either ask each other for help (if we're not already working together), then after 20 min of being stuck we should reach out to multiple resources (rocks, mentors, etc.)
