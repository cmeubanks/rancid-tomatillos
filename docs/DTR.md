# DTR: Define the Relationship

Project: 

Group Member Names:  Peter Muellerleile, Caroline Eubanks

Goals and Expectations for the Project (What does each group member hope to get out of this project? What do we want to achieve as a team? How will we know that we're successful?):

- Scores of at least 3 on all rubric categories. 
- Develop and demonstrate a solid fundamental understanding of React and React testing.
- Maintain consistent and open communication, and if any conflicts arise we bring them to the table direcly and compassionately.
	
Team strengths & collaboration styles:

- We both bring flexible, adaptive, and hard-working collaboration and work styles to the table and plan to continue emphasizing and strenthening these traits.

Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually? What constraints do we have? Make sure to discuss the remote questions above in regards to this section):

- During the week we'll ideally always take advantage of any afternoon work time, then continue working through the evening until a hard cutoff time of 8pm, with a short break after class to "go outside" and a longer break for dinner.
- Weekends: We'll take a short "walk around the block" break in the morning, then work through the rest of the day with short Poms every 45-60 min throughout.  Just like weeknights we'll take a longer dinner break around 6 and be calling it quits by 8 or 9.  

Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open? How will we make decisions as a team? How will we communicate about our emotional and mental well-being with each other?):

- We'll be talking every morning/afternoon on Slack, communicating consistantly in order to stay on the same page and plan our regular SH chats / paired programming sessions.  These have these meet-ups every afternoon and evening over Zoom and before wrapping up for the night establish a rough plan for the next day.

Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):

- We plan to distribute the work equitably, both working hard to pull our weight 50/50!

Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests/Debugging and Problem-solving Techniques): 

- Keep an eye on number of commits and PRs on GitHub and try to keep our contributions *roughly* even.
- Primarily work together over TeleType or Tuple to avoid merge conflicts.

Pomodoro Break Schedule:

- We both tend to forget to take breaks and plan to remind each other frequently!

What do we do when we get stuck?

- Either ask each other for help (if we're not already working together), then after 20 min of being stuck we should reach out to multiple resources (rocks, mentors, etc.)
